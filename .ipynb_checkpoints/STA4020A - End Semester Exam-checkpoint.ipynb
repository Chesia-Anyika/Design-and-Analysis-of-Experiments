    "**Imagine you are conducting a factorial experiment to study the effects of diet, exercise, and supplementation on health outcomes. The factors and their levels are as follows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Factor A: Diet (3 levels: Low, Medium, High) - Fixed Effect\n",
    "\n",
    "- Factor B: Exercise (2 levels: None, Daily) - Fixed Effect\n",

    "- Factor C: Supplement (2 levels: With, Without) - Fixed Effect\n",

    "1. Calculate the total number of possible treatment combinations for the given levels of each factor.\n",
    "2. Create a full factorial design matrix that lists all possible combinations of the levels ofFactors A, B, and C. Each row should represent a unique treatment combination.\n",
    "3. Assume you have collected data on a response variable (e.g., a health outcome) for eachtreatment combination. Perform a factorial ANOVA to assess the main effects and interaction effects of Factors A, B, and C on the response variable.\n",
    "4. Provide the ANOVA table summarizing the results, including the sum of squares, degrees of freedom, mean squares, F-values, and p-values for each main effect and interaction.\n",
