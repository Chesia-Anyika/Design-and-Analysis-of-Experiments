# Design and Analysis of Experiments (DOE) Course Repository

This repository contains assignments, quizzes, and exams for my **Design and Analysis of Experiments (DOE)** course.

## About Design and Analysis of Experiments (DOE)  
Design and Analysis of Experiments (DOE) is a systematic approach to planning, conducting, and analyzing experiments to understand the factors that influence processes or outcomes. The course focuses on various experimental designs, statistical analysis methods, and how to draw valid conclusions from experimental data. Key topics in this course include:
- **Experimental Design**: Types of designs like factorial, fractional factorial, and response surface designs.
- **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)**: Techniques to assess the significance of factors in experiments.
- **Optimization**: Methods to optimize processes or outcomes based on experimental results.
- **Statistical Models**: Linear and non-linear models used for analysis and inference.

## Repository Contents  
- **Assignments**: Practical exercises on experimental design and analysis of variance.
- **Quizzes**: Assessments of theoretical knowledge and problem-solving skills.
- **Exams**: Comprehensive evaluations of DOE concepts and their application.

This repository showcases my learning and work in understanding the principles and applications of Design and Analysis of Experiments.
